    "After establishing itself as a successful gourmet food company, Acme Gourmet Meals seeks to expand its business by reaching new customers. Thus far, the business has been designed such that the AGM location is based inside of an existing grocery store, with customers only able to pick up food from the store location. Under this model, the only option for expanding the business was by building new stores. Building new stores is a high-risk investment since it is very expensive because of the cost of real estate, equipment, and too many other factors. Also, given the nature of building new stores, it is not an agile process in which we cannot get a feedback quickly; we will have to wait till the entire investment is made, new store is operating and then see the return, which is a high risk.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exploratory research, we will explore two new cost-effective, highly agile methods to expand our business and provide our customers with a unique, convenient delivery experience.  We will focus our research on providing convenient and new pickup locations in BART stations and provide delivery using a hybrid mix of BART and new technologies like Robots and Drones. We will also provide a deep cost comparison and final recommendations. \n",

    "With the expansion location determined, we next need a measure of how many new customers are expected to be reached. In order to accomplish this, we used AGM's existing customer data from the Berkeley store in order to determine what percentage of people within the store's effective range were converted into AGM customers. \n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in the appendix section \"Calculating New Customer Metric\", the 15 mile radius of the Berkeley store reached a population of 2729857 and turned 7823 of them into customers. Thus, the new customer percentage was equal to 7823 / 2729857 = 0.29%. This indicates that for any population within a certain range, an average of 0.29% of them will be converted into AGM customers. As such, we will use that 0.29% of the total population in the region metric in order to conservatively estimate how many new customers are expected to be made with each delivery method. \n",
    "\n",
    "Do note that the new customer metric will differ for BART station pick-up, as BART stations have to account for two populations: the local population that lives within a range, and the ridership population that travels through the BART station. There was not a reliable source of data to indicate what the customer conversion rate would be for BART riders or for users living near BART stations, so we chose to modify the existing new customer conversion rate stated above.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to estimate the number of new customers gained from BART station ridership, we chose to use a new customer metric value of 0.5%. This value is higher than the regular new customer metric, as we believe that the close proximity and constant interaction with the AGM pick-up station in the BART station will serve as a form of advertisement and actually make customers more likely to purchase a meal compared to a standard delivery.\n",

    "In order to estimate the number of new customers gained from the local population nearby a BART station, we chose to use a new customer metric value of 0.05%. This value is lower than the regular new customer metric because we believe the relative lack of proximity to the pick-up station for non-BART riders will make users less likely to purchase a meal compared to standard delivery. Furthermore, we intentionally made a very conservative estimate in order to avoid the possibility of double-counting new customers who are both BART riders and who live nearby."

    "### BART Station Pickup\n",
    "\n",
    "Bay Area Rapid Transit is one of the most widely used public mass transit systems in the San Francisco Bay Area. With train stations all across the most populated regions around the bay, BART serves to shuttle hundreds of thousands of people as part of their daily commute. BART stations are distributed in cities across the bay, with many of the most busy stations being located in the most populated or active locations. Due to their distributed locality, connection to mass transit, and high volume of activity, BART Stations are logical choice to consider when expanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "AGM would facilitate meal deliveries using a meal-safe locker system within or nearby a BART station that users would pick up meals from. This locker system will be refrigerated to ensure that the meal safety, automated to maximize availability, and possess a large number of lockers to ensure the maximum number of meals will be available. The Penguin Lockers COFRIDGE CF_24 model is being used as our example model for all calculations. This model of refrigerated locker meets all of the requirements and is currently available on the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "For full notes and calculations regarding the BART Station Pickup kiosks, please refer to the appendix section \"BART Station Data and Calculations\" (Figure 4).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Effective Range\n",
    "\n",
    "When determining the effective range for the BART Station Pickup locker, there are two groups of customers that need to be considered: the local population nearby that travels to the station to pick up meals, and the BART riders who interact with the locker as part of their BART ride.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is difficult to determine the effective range of a locker kiosk on the local population, especially given that no similar data to use exists. However, we intuitively believe that the effective range for a locker would be 1 mile, as that is the longest distance that we believe an individual would be willing to walk to pick up their meal in the localized urban environment. As such, we are treating the effective range on the local population to be 1 mile.\n",
    "\n",
    "BART riders are considered a captive audience, since their strict travel routes require users in a BART station to be nearby every element of the station. As such, we believe that the effective range of the lockers on BART riders is perfect: every BART rider that goes in or out of the station would be considered within the effective range.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Predicted New Customers\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to determine how many new customers this would convert, we once again have to consider the two populations of the local population and the BART riders. Furthermore, we recognize that the new customer metric value may differ between the two populations, as the circumstances upon which both of them would interact with the locker are fundamentally different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within a BART station, we believe that the new customer metric would elevate above the standard 0.29% due to the unique circumstances of the BART riders. Given that the locker exists as a permanent and prominent fixture of the BART station that riders would see regularly, this will serve as a form of advertisement within that captive audience. As such, that will likely result in a greater level of curiosity, greater engagement, and thus a greater number of new customers for that population. As such, we estimate that the new customer metric would elevate to 0.5% of the total ridership population, thus equating to 212 new customers from the Montgomery Street station.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the local population nearby the BART station, we believe that the new customer metric would actually be lower than the standard percentage. Seeing as this local population does not ride BART, they will not be as immediately engaged with the locker. Furthermore, the lower footprint and lessened prominence of the locker compared to a physical location in a store also reduces visibility. However, this reduced visibility is more than made up by the sheer number of people nearby who will discovery and use the lockers eventually. As such, we estimate that the new customer metric would lower to 0.05% of the total local population, thus equating to 664 new customers from the local population around the Montgomery Street Station.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Operating Costs\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two primary costs associated with a BART Station locker system: the cost of renting the space and the locker system itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "BART does not currently have any information relating to how expensive it would be to rent space within a BART station. However, we have used a reasonable estimate based on the real estate costs and the estimated footage for the locker system to create an estimate of $600,000 per year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the cost of a locker system such as the Penguin Lockers CF_24 is currently not available to the public. However, we have used a reasonable estimate based on the specifications of the unit to create an estimated cost of $500,000 and an estimated lifespan of 5 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Future Developments \n",
    "\n",
    "Refrigerated locker systems are a relatively new technology that continues to iterate and advance year after year. New versions of locker systems will likely be cheaper, more energy efficient, more space efficient, and offer many new and exciting features. While it is unlikely that locker systems will need to be replaced or upgraded frequently, technological innovations may make locker systems more enticing.\n",
    "\n",
    "BART stations do not change frequently, but it is possible that circumstances can change for better or for worse. BART ridership continues to grow post-pandemic, especially as commuters return to working in the office. Existing stations may see improvement projects that lead to improved amenities and increased ridership. But it is also a possibility that BART declines or becomes non-feasible, such as new policies or regulations against renting space within a BART station or declining budgets lead to declining facilities. It's impossible to know what the future holds, so we must be prepared for either outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practical Availability\n",
    "\n",
    "Refrigerated locker systems are currently available and in use across the world. While they currently exist in relatively small numbers, the popularity of such systems is expanding as companies begin to incorporate meal pick-up kiosk models into their business. As such, barring any outstanding circumstances, BART station pickup lockers could be incorporated immediately."

    "### Delivery Robot\n",
    "\n",
    "Delivery robots are ground-based robots that move via tracks, wheels, or mechanical legs in order to deliver packages from one location to another. As industrialization and online ordering became highly prevalent, so too did the demand for package delivery. Delivery robots are touted as a viable alternative to traditional human or machinery-based delivery methods due to their low expense, accurate automation, and easy of scaling up. Companies such as Amazon, Boston Dynamics, and Kiwibot are spearheading the delivery robot industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "AGM would facilitate meal deliveries with a delivery robot by having the robot deliver meals to customers from a centralized location. These delivery robots would need to be able to deliver meals to locations autonomously and rapidly, along with having the ability to control who can access the package to ensure accurate delivery. The Kiwibot 4.0 is one of the delivery robots that is having the most success, having been successfully trialed for use in Berkeley, CA. Because of this track record, Kiwibot 4.0 is an ideal example of a delivery robot to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "For full notes and calculations regarding the delivery robots, please refer to the appendix section \"Delivery Robot Data and Calculations\" (Figure 5).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Effective Range\n",
    "\n",
    "Kiwibot's technical specifications state that the robot has a maximum range of 12 miles. However, this does not account for round-trip distance nor does it account for the navigational difficulties of city blocks that prevent direct point-to-point travel. After accounting for a round-trip and creating an estimate for the added length of travel inherent with city blocks, the effective range of a Kiwibot is estimated to be 4 miles.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Predicted New Customers\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to determine how many new customers would be converted using this method, we use the new customer metric of 0.29% with the total population within range of the robot. From the Montgomery Street station, approximately 361,437 are within the 4 mile range of the delivery robot. As such, we estimate that using the delivery robot will create 1048 new customers from the local population.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Operating Costs\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than dealing with the complexities of purchasing, maintaining, and using our own fleet of delivery robots, it would be much simpler to instead utilize the Kiwibot company and its existing fleet of delivery drones to facilitate deliveries. Kiwibot's current business model is to charge a flat $4.00 fee for every delivery made. It is unknown whether a possible partnership could be arranged to secure a reduced fee, so that four dollar fee should be considered a conservative estimate. As such, it is assumed that every meal purchased will have an added four dollar fee to cover for that added delivery cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Future Developments \n",
    "\n",
    "Delivery robots are a relatively new technology that continues to iterate and advance year after year. New versions of delivery robots will likely be cheaper, more energy efficient, more space efficient, have greater range, and offer many new and exciting features. Seeing as wear and tear will inevitably cause the robots to diminish, there will be plenty of opportunities for new generations of robots to be put to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the successful trials of delivery robots such as Kiwibot have caused delivery robots to expand into new locations across the country. As the viability of delivery robots is proven in the mainstream, we can expect delivery robots to become increasingly common and accepted in society. Thus we can anticipate reduced friction with expanding into new locations in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practical Availability\n",
    "\n",
    "Delivery robots are currently available and in use in select cities around the world, but face strict regulation within San Francisco itself. Per current regulations, delivery robot companies are limited in the size of their fleet, and they cannot operate within residential areas. As such, it is currently not possible to operate a delivery robot in the Montgomery Street station area. However, we are confident that the increasing popularity and adoption of delivery robots elsewhere will make deregulation within San Francisco inevitable within a few years. Barring any outstanding circumstances or legal obstacles, delivery robots should be expected to be incorporated within 1-5 years."

    "Delivery drones are aerial robots that move via either top-mounted propellers (like a helicopter) or a front-mounted propeller (like an airplane) in order to deliver packages from one location to another. Due to their aerial nature, delivery drones are considered a separate and perhaps complimentary delivery method for ground-based delivery robots. Delivery drones are touted as a viable alternative to traditional human or machinery-based delivery methods due to their low expense, accurate automation, easy of scaling up, and increased delivery speeds within certain ranges. Companies such as Amazon, UPS, and Matternet are spearheading the delivery drone industry.\n",

The Matternet M2 is one of the delivery drones that is having the most success in the industry currently, first making history by being the first drone to deliver COVID-19 vaccine delivery within the US. Because of this track record, the Matternet M2 is an ideal example of a delivery robot to use.\n",

    "The M2's technical specifications state that the robot has a maximum range of 12 miles. While an aerial copter is able to travel directly from point to point over city blocks, this range does not account for round-trip distance nor elevation. After accounting for a round-trip and trivial elevation distances, the effective range of a Kiwibot is estimated to be 6 miles.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Predicted New Customers\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to determine how many new customers would be converted using this method, we use the new customer metric of 0.29% with the total population within range of the drone. From the Montgomery Street station, approximately 606,560 are within the 6 mile range of the delivery robot. As such, we estimate that using the delivery robot will create 1759 new customers from the local population.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Operating Costs\n",
    "\n",
    "While no publicly available information is available regarding the exact cost of operating a Matternet M2 unit, we can piece together an estimated operating cost based on the cost and life of the unit along with the estimated cost per delivery.\n",
    "\n",
    "The M2 unit has an estimated cost of $7500 according to www.engineeringforchange.org. Furthermore, it is estimated that the lifespan of a delivery drone in constant use is approximately 2 years maximum. As such, the amortized annual cost for purchasing the unit is 3750 dollars. Furthermore, the Intelligent Transformation Systems Joint Program Office with the US Department of Transportation estimates that drone deliveries cost about 88 cents per delivery.\n",

    "\n",
    "While delivery drones have not seen as much immediate success and adoption as delivery robots in mainstream society, a lot of attention has been put on making delivery drones viable for industrial purposes and for mainstream usage. As the technology continues to develop and as big companies such as Amazon, UPS, and Matternet advance its adoption, we can expect delivery drones to become a novelty in the next few years, and then fully adopted in a few short years after that. Thus we can anticipate reduced friction with expanding into new locations in the future.\n",

    "Delivery drones are currently pretty rare and reserved for only niche uses in a few locations. While they exist in small numbers, the popularity of delivery drones is expanding year after year. Still, they face all of the same regulations in San Francisco that affects delivery robots, making them not viable currently but potentially viable in a few years.

However, as delivery drones become adopted and normalized, we expect San Francisco's regulations to change, and thus delivery drones will become a possible option within 5-10 years."

    "# Limitation and Concerns\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Our Population data is based on AGM's `zip_codes` table, and the data is not granular enough. The population is calculated based on the sum of the population of each zip code within X number of miles. This means it can include individuals in the zipcode but who live more than X miles from the station. A more granular data that provides a rough estimate for the number of people who lives within a given radius will provide more accurate results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. AGM's customer location is based on their zip code saved in `customers` table, so we have the same limitation as Population data. A customer can live on the edge of a zip code and outside the range of X miles radius from the station but still gets included in our analysis. A more accurate customer location/ address will improve our analysis. Cell Phone GPS can capture the customer's Latitude and Longitude when the customer is registering and saved in DB.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The customer conversion percentage that was used to calculate the estimated number of new customer per delivery method was derived from the percentage of new customers from the Berkeley store. However, the number of new customers who use the Berkeley store may not be representative of the number of customers who will use the delivery methods. The Berkeley store's new customer conversion rate was used as a proxy for the lack of data regarding the number of new customers using the delivery methods; in the future, more research or better data would yield more accurate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The amount of estimated revenues per delivery method was calculated based on the sales data from the Berkeley store and applied to each of the delivery methods. However, the nature of the delivery methods is different from the Berkeley store, and thus the size and frequency of orders may differ between the two. No information was available regarding the size and frequency of delivery orders, so the Berkeley store data was used as a proxy; in the future, more research or better data would yield more accurate data."

    "During our research, we got a chance to use multiple technologies, and we want to discuss them briefly, show the trade-off we learned, and what's needed before we go to production and what would be best for future usage that fits the company growth. \n",

    "**SQL vs. NO-SQL** \n",
    "\n",
    "Our main DB is a SQL DB; that's where all of our data is stored. The data is stored in a 3rd normal form with no duplicates, which is great for faster writes since we only need to update the data in one place and also great for optimal storage since the data is stored once. \n",
    "\n",
    "At some point in our research, we needed all station data like Population around the station, Ridership, Yelp data, and the number of existing customers to be stored in one JSON formatted document. We needed that to provide faster analysis. So the usage of NO SQL DB would have been ideal in this case; we would sacrifice some redundancy for faster analysis. The workaround we did is to use python to build a JSON model that collects all the data for the SQL DB and other sources. \n",
    "\n",
    "With that in mind, we recommend setting up MongoDB Cluster. \n",

    "During Drone or Robots delivery, we assume that the machine is equipped with GPS and would submit its location every few seconds. Later, the location gets viewed/ used by multiple other systems like the users themselves checking on the order location, our diagnostic system making sure that the machine is on its way and making progress, or the route mapping system to redirect the machine in case of new routes are available. \n",

    "### Business Suggestions and Conclusion\n",
    "After a lot of time spent reviewing and analyzing various data points from AGM and other sources, we believe that we were able to come up with the best strategic approach that can help AGM expand with the use of different delivery methods and unique location opportunities. Our suggestion, will cover three diffferent sections that include immidiate execution, short term tasks(within 1-5 years), and long term tasks(within 5-10 years). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Immediate Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "to kick off our expansion efforts our recommendation is to begin with launching our first AGM pick up locker in the Montgomery Street BART Station. Based on our research we determined that this is the ideal location to begin our expansion because it is around the highest populated areas in the entire Bay area, has one of the largest BART riderships, and we believe the area is close to a lot of foodies that would want to try our product according to the many restaurants in that area. \n",
    "\n",
    "We believe that starting with a pick up location is ideal because it is something that is very feasable and requires minimal effort and initial capital. Once our first location is set up we will monitor its performance trought out the first year to ensure that our projected profits of ~$1,347,668 is accurate before expanding to other areas. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Short-Term Tasks 1-5 years\n",
    "\n",
    "1-3 years:\n",
    "For our next steps in our expansion efforts we aim to utilize the success we see in our Montgomery pick up lockers and expand the same business model to 4 other BART Stations which are the Embarcadero Station, Powell Street, Civic Center, and 19th st.\n",
    "These BART stations were also selected because they have the highests ridership figures and are around very high populated areads\n",
    "\n",
    "3-5 years: \n",
    "As our pick up locations expand and createa more immeidiate revenue strean, we also want to explore other delivery options that can help us reach even more customers. Around the 3-5 year mark our plan is to star implementing the use of Delivery Robots because based on our research, delivery robots are a great way for us to dive into the delivery market with a low expense option that allows us as a company to expand at our own pace. Although robots are not a viable option in San Francisco today due to regulations, we are closely monitoring this option and studying how they are being used in other cities around the world. Because there has been very high adoption of robots in other cities, we believe that San Francisco will easy its regulations within a 5 year period and at that point, prices might go down even more for the cost of operation our own small fleet of delivery robots. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Long-Term Tasks 5-10 years\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we are able to successfully have 5 BART pick up locations that include locker pick up stations and also have a fleet of delivery robots, our next steps would be to search other BART staions or locations where we can implement a similar model with a low cost of operation. We will continue to research the next location based on population and potential client base. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we would also want to finish our expansion model with our third delivery option of having delivery drones. After completing our research the delivery drones are by far the most cost effective option and very easy to scale out with great revenues. However, the big down side is that it is not used in many cities yet therefore San Francisco has very strict regulations on this today. Based on our research, we are concluding that drone delivery mighht start to become a much more viable option in San Franciso in 5-8 year. "
