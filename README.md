# Ryan S. Wong's GitHub Portolio

Welcome to Ryan S. Wong's Github portfolio page. This is a collection of many of the technical projects that I have been involved with, whether as a gradute student at UC Berkeley or as part of a personal project. Each entry below will have a brief description of the project in question along with any supporting documents to go along with them.

### Layers and Livelihoods
![Layers and Livelihoods Presentation Picture](/images/layers-and-livelihoods-presentation.JPG)
A machine learning project to create and fit a model that would enable corporate HR departments to predict which data scientist employees were actively looking for a different job. Utilized an HR analytics data set on Kaggle with over 21,000 responses, assessed the effectiveness of 8 different types of models, and successfully created a Non-Linear Support Vector Machine model that could predict employee retention with a 76.5% successful test recall rate.

### Can We Optimize World Happiness?
![Can We Optimize World Happiness Presentation Picture](/images/can-we-optimize-happiness-presentation.JPG)
A data analytics and statistical prediction project utilizing data from the 2021 World Happiness Reports. A linear regression model was applied to data from over 149 countries and evaluated with a coefficient T-Test at a 95% confidence level in order to determine whether a county's wealth had a statistically significant influence in its citizens' happiness.

### The Water Tables
![Precipitation and Drought Severity Visualization Picture](/images/precipitation-and-drought-severity-pic.JPG)
A data engineering and visualization project that combined precipitation and drought data for counties across the United States in order to illustrate trends in climate change from 2000 to 2016. Drought data from the National Drought Mitigation Center and precipitation data from the Center for Disease Control was combined, cleaned, and feature engineered to create an interactive visualization using Tableau.

### Analysis of Crime and Justice in Cook County
![Crime and Justice Presentation Picture](/images/crime_and_justice_pic.JPG)
A data engineering, visualization, and analysis project that investigated injustice and unfair treatment with criminal sentencing in Cook County, Illinois. The court sentencing data was analyzed to determine how the demographics of the criminal population differ from that of the civilian population, how severely certain crimes are punished, and how criminals may have been sentenced preferentially light or severely harsh based on their demographics.

### Business Strategy for Expanding Acme Gourmet Meals

A data engineering, visualization, and analysis project that plotted and proposed a data-supported business strategy for expanding a hypothetical food company. Data from Yelp's API, Google Maps, municipal BART ridership data, and the company's in-house SQL database was combined and analyzed in order to evaluate possible business strategies, explore potential food delivery methods using real-time technical specifications, and ultimately determine the company's potential profitability.

### Data Cleaning and Analysis of Pathogenic Genetic Mutations from ClinVar Data
![Picture of ClinVar Data](/images/pathogenic-clinvar-picture.JPG)
A data engineering and analysis project that utilized the open source ClinVar data set in order to identify pathogenic genetic mutations. The data had to be injested, cleaned, and analyzed in order to provide evidence-based business suggestions for a hypothetical medical data and technology company.

## Other Projects

### Kosmos 
Worked as a contract front-end software developer for the Fin-Tech startup company Kosmos. Created reusable and reactive web elements for their new wealth and asset management web platform using React Native. The company was acquired in 2022.

### Steam Friends Co-Op Game Suggestor
Created a game suggestion tool that utilized Steam's SteamFriends API. The program collected and compared the Steam game libraries of two of my friends, appended data of the games we shared to find which games could be played cooperatively together, and suggested a list of games that we could play. This tool allowed us to quickly and easily figure out what Steam games we could play together while hanging out.
